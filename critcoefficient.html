							<center><h2>Basic Info</h2>
							<p>This table is used to determine your crit damage coefficient. The basic formula is </p>
							<p>Crit Coefficient = (1 + (CRIT RATE * CRIT DMG))</p>
							<p>In the simplest term, take your total crit rate and multiply your total crit dmg and add 1 to it. This tells you that every time you land a crit, your total dmg is increase by this amount. Say you have <b>40% crit rate and 500% crit dmg</b>.</p>
							<p>(1 + (0.4 x 5)) = <b>3</b>, meaning whenever you attack, you have an average crit coefficient of 3. You don't always do 500% more damage because your crit rate is not 100%. For every hit, you have 40% chance to land a crit, which deals 500% more damage. When you average out, it's about 3 times more damage instead. This is what the coefficient means.</p>
							<p>Now to make things complicated, we introduce Crit Resistance</p>
							<p>Crit Res is a stat that both players and enemies can have. Some bosses have tested to have 0% Crit Res, most bosses are vague number of Crit Res. The only two locations where you can find exact crit res is the Dark Trial and other players on the info screen.</p></center>
							
							<center><h2>How does Crit Res comes into play?</h2>
							<p>The updated formula is as follows:</p>
							<p>Crit Multiplier = 1 + [CRIT RATE * (CRIT DMG/CRIT RES)]</p>
							<p>Let's use the same example as above and introduce <b>200% Crit Res</b>, which is quite common. Some players have as high as 400%, and some bosses in Dark Trial can have upwards of 500-600% Crit Res.</p>
							<p>Crit Coefficient = 1 + [0.4 x (5/4)] = 1.5</p>
							<p>Yup, you went from doing 3 times more damage down to <b>1.5</b>, which is the generic amount. The crit coefficient has a cap of 1.5 because the game will always reward you 1.5x damage for landing a crit. It wouldn't make sense if someone CRIT RES is so high that your crit now do negative damage. Wouldn't make sense now would it.</p>
							<p>Now that the basic explanation is out of the way, the table above provides crit rate in range of 10% and crit dmg in range of 50%, starting at 600%. The assumed Crit Res in this case is 500%, which is good to use as a gauge.</p></center>
